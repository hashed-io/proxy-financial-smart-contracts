## **Create Telos account**
First we need to access the official Telos [site](https://www.telos.net/signup) to get this view:

</br>

<img src="./images/image2.png" alt="image2.png" style="height: 450px; width:520px;"/>

</br>

1. Select an account name:
- The account name must contain 12 lowercase characters only and number from 1 to 5.
- If you see a message like: `The account "usertest1212" already exists`, please change the name of the account.

2. Copy and save **both** keys (public & private): For example in a blocnotes file.

- These keys ensure that only you can access and perform actions with your account. Your public key is visible by everyone using the network. The private key, however, will never be shown. You must store your private key in a safe location as it should not be shared with anyone.

- **IMPORTANT:**  Save your keys somewhere safe. They will not be stored for you. Once you exit this window, you'll **NEVER** be able to recover these keys. 
-  Keep in mind that if you lose your keys, you lose your account. *Make as many backup copies as you think necessary*.

</br>

**Note:** See this [tutorial](#reference3) for more information related to backups. 

3. Check the box: `I have copied my keys somewhere safe`.

</br>

<img src="./images/image3.png" alt="image3.png" style="height: 150px; width:300px;"/>

</br>

4. Check the next box: `I'm not a robot`.

</br>

<img src="./images/image4.png" alt="image4.png" style="height: 150px; width:300px;"/>

</br>

5. Remember to copy both keys to a safe place before continuing.
Click on `Continue`.

</br>

<img src="./images/image5.png" alt="image5.png" style="height: 100px; width:500px;"/>

# **How to install Anchor**

---

We need a `Wallet` with the intention of saving our keys and being able to sign and perform transactions. We recommend `Anchor Wallet`.

    "Anchor is a security and privacy focused open-source digital wallet for all EOSIO-based networks."

**Note:** Due to different versions and updates of `Anchor Wallet`, the interface you see may vary slightly.

</br>

1. First, we need to download Anchor fromAnchor its Official site, [here](https://greymass.com/en/anchor/download). You'll see the next window: 
Anchor

</br>

<img src="./images/image9.png" alt="image9.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

<img src="./images/image13.png" alt="image13.png" style="height: 400px; width:450px;"/>

</br>

6. Check the box `Run Anchor Wallet`.

<img src="./images/image14.png" alt="image14.png" style="height: 400px; width:450px;"/>

</br>

7. You should see a similar window like this:

</br>

<img src="./images/image15.png" alt="image15.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

8. Click on `Setup an Account`.

</br>

<img src="./images/image16.png" alt="image16.png" style="height: 100px; width:250px;"/>

</br>

9. Then you'll see the next window. Here you need to define a password for your wallet. **Save it!** As the warning says, if you forget or lose your wallet's password, you won't be able to recover your wallet in the future. *Make as many backup copies as you think necessary.*

</br>

**Note:** See this [tutorial](#reference3) for more information related to backups. 

</br>

</br>

<img src="./images/image19.png" alt="image19.png" style="height: 450px; width:750px;"/>

</br>


12. Next step if to import your previous `Telos account` to your `Anchor Wallet`. After select the `Telos chain`, you'll see the next, click on `Import an existing Account`. 

</br>

<img src="./images/image20.png" alt="image20.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

13. Then click on `Import Private Key`.

</br>

<img src="./images/image21.png" alt="image21.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

14. Now we need to copy/paste our previous `private key`. Make sure to paste the `private key`, if you try to paste the `public key`, Anchor won't be able to find your account. 

</br>

<img src="./images/image22.png" alt="image22.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

15. `Anchor` may take a while to find your account, be patient. After a while, you'll see a new section called `Accounts found to match key` and below the public key associated to your `private key`. Select both accounts:
 - `youraccountname@active` 
 - `youraccountname@owner`

</br>

<img src="./images/image23.png" alt="image23.pngo" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

16. Then click on `Import Account(s)`

</br>

<img src="./images/image24.png" alt="image24.png" style="height: 100px; width:250px;"/>

</br>

17. `Anchor` will pop-up a new window `Authorization Required`, type your Wallet's password and then click on `Authorize`.

</br>

<img src="./images/image25.png" alt="image25.png" style="height: 350px; width:600px;"/>

</br>

18. Next you should see something like this:


</br>

<img src="./images/image26.png" alt="image26.png" style="height: 350px; width:600px;"/>

</br>

# **How to Safely Store Your Wallet**

--- 
In the next tutorial, we're going to talk about some concepts related to wallets & keys so you can be familiar with these concepts.

- ### **About Keys**

You will be given two kinds of keys: a public key, which functions similar to an email address (you may safely share it with others, enabling you to send and receive payments), and a private key, which is often a string of letters and numbers (and which is not to be shared with anyone). 

- ### **What is a private key?**

A `private key` is a secret string of letters and numbers that allows you to access and manage your cryptocurrency funds. It is like a password that proves your ownership of your cryptocurrency.

-  ### **About Wallets**

Just like your bank PIN, it’s important to keep your private keys safe! Store them offline somewhere safe. Some investors choose to keep their private keys on a computer that isn’t connected to the internet, written on pieces of paper, or even just memorized.

A common misconception in cryptocurrency regarding wallets is that they store tokens. However, in reality, a wallet is used to store private keys in an encrypted file to sign transactions. Wallets do not serve as a storage medium for tokens.

A user builds a transaction object, usually through an interface (`Proxy website`), sends that object to the wallet to be signed (`Anchor Wallet`), the wallet then returns that transaction object with a signature which is then broadcast to the network. When/if the network confirms that the transaction is valid, it is included into a block on the blockchain.

- ### **Where To Store Private Keys?**

1. **Hardware Wallets:**  Use hardware wallets to keep your private keys safe. A hardware wallet is a flash drive-like device, designed specifically for storing your private keys.

2. **Online? AT YOUR OWN RISK!:** Is not recommended keep private keys online, in the mail, or in the cloud because they are most susceptible to getting hacked there. A lot of users take screenshots of the private keys, and their photo album is usually synced online. This creates a security risk and is something you should at your own risk.

3. **Offline Flash drive:** If you don’t have a hardware wallet, you can temporarily keep your private keys or seed in an offline flash drive or HDD. But these options are only safe as long as they aren’t in the hands of an attacker. 

4. **Paper wallet:** A paper wallet is free and is just a piece of paper that prints the pair of private and public keys on it. 

5. **Memorize it:** It is pretty much hard to memorize your private key. 

Having said that, we hope these insights will help you in making the best decision for yourself and also help you secure your private keys.
