## **Create Telos account**
First we need to access the official Telos [site](https://www.telos.net/signup) to get this view:

</br>

1. Select an account name:
- The account name must contain 12 lowercase characters only and number from 1 to 5.
- If you see a message like: `The account "usertest1212" already exists`, please change the name of the account.

2. Copy and save **both** keys (public & private): For example in a blocnotes file.

- These keys ensure that only you can access and perform actions with your account. Your public key is visible by everyone using the network. The private key, however, will never be shown. You must store your private key in a safe location as it should not be shared with anyone.

- **IMPORTANT:**  Save your keys somewhere safe. They will not be stored for you. Once you exit this window, you'll **NEVER** be able to recover these keys. 
-  Keep in mind that if you lose your keys, you lose your account. *Make as many backup copies as you think necessary*.

3. Check the box: `I have copied my keys somewhere safe`.

</br>

Click on `Continue`.

</br>

# **How to install Anchor**

We need a `Wallet` with the intention of saving our keys and being able to sign and perform transactions. We recommend `Anchor Wallet`.

1. First, we need to download Anchor fromAnchor its Official site, [here](https://greymass.com/en/anchor/download). You'll see the next window:

</br>

9. Then you'll see the next window. Here you need to define a password for your wallet. **Save it!** As the warning says, if you forget or lose your wallet's password, you won't be able to recover your wallet in the future. *Make as many backup copies as you think necessary.*

<img src="./images/image21.png" alt="image21.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

14. Now we need to copy/paste our previous `private key`. Make sure to paste the `private key`, if you try to paste the `public key`, Anchor won't be able to find your account. 

</br>

<img src="./images/image22.png" alt="image22.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

15. `Anchor` may take a while to find your account, be patient. After a while, you'll see a new section called `Accounts found to match key` and below the public key associated to your `private key`. Select both accounts:
 - `youraccountname@active` 
 - `youraccountname@owner`

</br>

<img src="./images/image23.png" alt="image23.pngo" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

16. Then click on `Import Account(s)`

</br>

<img src="./images/image24.png" alt="image24.png" style="height: 100px; width:250px;"/>

</br>

17. `Anchor` will pop-up a new window `Authorization Required`, type your Wallet's password and then click on `Authorize`.

</br>

<img src="./images/image25.png" alt="image25.png" style="height: 350px; width:600px;"/>

</br>

18. Next you should see something like this:


</br>

<img src="./images/image26.png" alt="image26.png" style="height: 350px; width:600px;"/>

</br>
