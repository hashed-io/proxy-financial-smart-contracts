# **How to create a Telos account**

---

First, we need to access the official Telos [site](https://www.telos.net/signup) to get this view:

</br>

<img src="./images/image2.png" alt="image2.png" style="height: 450px; width:520px;"/>

</br>

1. Select an account name:
- The account name must contain 12 lowercase characters only and numbers from 1 to 5.
- If you see a message like: `The account "usertest1212" already exists, please change the account's name.

2. Copy and save **both** keys (public & private): For example, in a bloc notes file.

- These keys ensure that only you can access and perform actions with your account. Your public key is visible to everyone using the network. The private key, however, will never be shown. Therefore, you must store your private key in a safe location as it should not be shared with anyone.

- **IMPORTANT:**  Save your keys somewhere safe. They will not be stored for you. Once you exit this window, you'll **NEVER** be able to recover these keys. 
-  Keep in mind that losing your keys means losing your account. *Make as many backup copies as you think necessary*.

</br>

**Note:** See this [tutorial](#reference3) for more information related to backups. 

3. Check the box: `I have copied my keys somewhere safe.`

</br>

<img src="./images/image3.png" alt="image3.png" style="height: 150px; width:300px;"/>

</br>

4. Check the following box: `I'm not a robot.

</br>

<img src="./images/image4.png" alt="image4.png" style="height: 150px; width:300px;"/>

</br>

5. Remember to copy both keys to a safe place before continuing.
Click on `Continue.`

</br>

<img src="./images/image5.png" alt="image5.png" style="height: 100px; width:500px;"/>

</br>

6. Congratulations, your account has been created!

</br>

<img src="./images/image6.png" alt="image6.png" style="height: 600px; width:500px;"/>

</br>

7. Next step is to log in with your new account. Before doing so, please refer to the following [tutorial](#reference1): `"How to install Anchor." ` After that, you can close the current tab; we won't modify any aspect of our account.

# **How to install Anchor**

---

We need a `Wallet` to save our keys and be able to sign and perform transactions. Therefore, we recommend `Anchor Wallet.`

    "Anchor is a security and privacy-focused open-source digital wallet for all EOSIO-based networks."

**Note:** Due to different versions and updates of `Anchor Wallet,` the interface you see may vary slightly.

</br>

1. First, we need to download Anchor from its Official site, [here](https://greymass.com/en/anchor/download). You'll see the following window: 
Anchor

</br>

<img src="./images/image9.png" alt="image9.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

**Note:** You can manage your wallet from your personal computer or with your smartphone.

Anchor is available for the following Operating Systems:
- macOS
- Windows
- Linux

2. Click on `Download for Windows` if you're using a computer with Windows; if not, click on the icons below to select your operating system:

<img src="./images/image10.png" alt="image10.png" style="height: 100px; width:350px;"/>

Once the download is complete, click on the executable and follow the steps.

<img src="./images/image11.png" alt="image11.png" style="height: 100px; width:450px;"/>

</br>

4. Select the destination folder, then click on `install.`

<img src="./images/image12.png" alt="image12.png" style="height: 400px; width:450px;"/>

</br>

5. Wait for the installation, then click on `Next.`

</br>

<img src="./images/image13.png" alt="image13.png" style="height: 400px; width:450px;"/>

</br>

6. Check the box `Run Anchor Wallet.`

<img src="./images/image14.png" alt="image14.png" style="height: 400px; width:450px;"/>

</br>

7. You should see a similar window like this:

</br>

<img src="./images/image15.png" alt="image15.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

8. Click on `Setup an Account.`

</br>

<img src="./images/image16.png" alt="image16.png" style="height: 100px; width:250px;"/>

</br>

9. Then, you'll see the following window. Here it would help if you defined a password for your wallet. **Save it!** As the warning says, if you forget or lose your wallet password, you won't be able to recover your wallet in the future. *Make as many backup copies as you think necessary.*

</br>

**Note:** See this [tutorial](#reference3) for more information related to backups. 

</br>

<img src="./images/image17.png" alt="image17.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

10. Once you have saved your password in a safe place. Click on `Set password.`

</br>

<img src="./images/image18.png" alt="image18.png" style="height: 400px; width:650px;"/>

</br>


11. Next, you should see something like this: Select the `Telos` chain.

</br>

<img src="./images/image19.png" alt="image19.png" style="height: 450px; width:750px;"/>

</br>


12. The next step is to import your previous `Telos account` to your `Anchor Wallet.` After selecting the `Telos chain,` you'll see the next, click on `Import an existing Account.` 

</br>

<img src="./images/image20.png" alt="image20.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

13. Then click on `Import Private Key.`

</br>

<img src="./images/image21.png" alt="image21.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

14. We need to copy/paste our previous private key. Make sure to paste the `private key`; if you try to paste the `public key,` Anchor won't be able to find your account. 

</br>

<img src="./images/image22.png" alt="image22.png" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

15. `Anchor` may take a while to find your account, be patient. After a time, you'll see a new section called `Accounts found to match key` below the public key associated with your `private key.` Select both accounts:
 - `youraccountname@active` 
 - `youraccountname@owner`

</br>

<img src="./images/image23.png" alt="image23.pngo" style="height: 500px; width:750px;"/>

</br>

16. Then click on `Import Account(s).`

</br>

<img src="./images/image24.png" alt="image24.png" style="height: 100px; width:250px;"/>

</br>

17. `Anchor` will pop up a new window, `Authorization Required,` type your Wallet password and then click on `Authorize.`

</br>

<img src="./images/image25.png" alt="image25.png" style="height: 350px; width:600px;"/>

</br>

18. Next, you should see something like this:


</br>

<img src="./images/image26.png" alt="image26.png" style="height: 350px; width:600px;"/>

</br>

19. **Congratulations!**, now you have Anchor installed and an `Anchor Wallet` with the `public & private keys` associated with your account.

20. Finally, we must log in to the official Proxy [website](). Follow the next [tutorial](#reference2): `"How to log in the Proxy website"`.

# **How to Safely Store Your Wallet**

--- 
In the following tutorial, we'll talk about some concepts related to wallets & keys so you can be familiar with these concepts.

- ### **About Keys**

You will be given two kinds of keys: a public key, which functions similar to an email address (you may safely share it with others, enabling you to send and receive payments), and a private key, which is often a string of letters and numbers (and which is not to be shared with anyone). 

- ### **What is a private key?**

A `private key` is a secret string of letters and numbers that allows you to access and manage your cryptocurrency funds. It is like a password that proves your ownership of your cryptocurrency.

-  ### **About Wallets**

Just like your bank PIN, keeping your private keys safe is important! Store them offline somewhere safe. Some investors keep their private keys on a computer that isn't connected to the internet, written on pieces of paper, or even just memorized.

A common misconception in cryptocurrency regarding wallets is that they store tokens. However, a wallet is used to store private keys in an encrypted file to sign transactions. Therefore, wallets don't serve as a storage medium for tokens.

A user builds a transaction object, usually through an interface (`Proxy website`), sends that object to the wallet to be signed (`Anchor Wallet`); the wallet then returns that transaction object with a signature which is then broadcast to the network. When/if the network confirms that the transaction is valid, it is included in a blockchain block.

- ### **Where To Store Private Keys?**

1. **Hardware Wallets:**  Use hardware wallets to keep your private keys safe. A hardware wallet is a flash drive-like device designed specifically for storing your private keys.

2. **Online? AT YOUR OWN RISK!:** It's not recommended to keep private keys online, in the mail, or in the cloud because they are most susceptible to getting hacked there. Many users take screenshots of their private keys, and their photo album is usually synced online. This previous action creates a security risk and is something you should do at your own risk.

3. **Offline Flash drive:** If you don't have a hardware wallet, you can temporarily keep your private keys or seed in an offline flash drive or HDD. But these options are only safe as long as they aren't in the hands of an attacker. 

4. **Paper wallet:** A paper wallet is free and is just a piece of paper that prints the pair of private and public keys on it. 

5. **Memorize it:** It's hard to memorize your private key. 

We hope these insights will help you make the best decision for yourself and also help you secure your private keys.
